                <article>Current and future trends in Kabylia will undoubtedly be decisive for the future and the very survival of Berber identity.It is inhabited by a dynamic and peaceful population which makes liberty the most sacred value of its existence. Land of all aspirations, it has seen many invaders.</article>

        <article>Kabylia has a unique and characteristic culture, language, legal system, and history. Most of the Kabyle population is strongly anchored in the environment and attached to its land and its traditional territory. It has often, for generations, been stalked and subjugated, a victim of destruction of their culture, discrimination and widespread violations of their human rights. For centuries, it has suffered from the non-recognition of its political and cultural institutions, and the integrity of its culture has been undermined.</article>

        <article>It has been supported by the persistence of the anti-Kabyle policy of the Algerian regime on a stigmatized population, and subjected to particularly violent state policies.
                The principle of all sovereignty resides essentially in “The Nation”, and yet after independence in 1962, Kabylia is misled by a pseudo-sovereignty that it thinks it holds precisely because it is “The State”.</article>

                 <article>Kabylia has remained a region apart, before and after, and always considered a rebel region, before and after historical events: opposed to the Romans, the Arabs, the Turks and then the French. In the fight against the colonizer, they hoped in return for recognition of their specificity within the Algerian nation. Socialist Algeria did not recognize their language, their culture, or even really the role played by their leaders in the war for the independence of Algeria. The Kabyles were marginalized in the upper echelons of the new power and successive presidents, Ahmed Ben Bella, Houari Boumediene, Bouteflika as well as Teboune today, guided by the generals of the Oujda clan, who continue to Arabize and Islamize this population.</article>

        <article>The Kabyle believe in preserving the family. Even when a family member is forced by economic or social reasons to migrate to cities in Northern Africa or Europe, family ties remain strong. Family unity is further strengthened in their marriage customs and inheritance rights. Often times, an entire family lives in one small hut, sharing everything. The father is the head of the family, and the family ancestry is traced through the males. According to tradition, a local assembly, which is made up of the heads of all families, governs the villages.</article>
